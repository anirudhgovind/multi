# multi: Morphometric UtiLiTIes

> **Warning** This package is under active development. The API may
> change.

multi (Morphometric UtiLiTIes) provides utility functions that make
basic steps — cleaning street networks, creating spatial units, etc. —
in urban morphometric analyses easier. multi is meant to work with other
packages in the R ecosystem and, as such, does not duplicate already
implemented functionality.

## Installation

You can install the development version of multi from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("anirudhgovind/multi")
```
